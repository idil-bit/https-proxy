# https-proxy
Authors: Idil Kolabas and Kimaya Wijeratna

Compile the proxy by make. Run it by ./a.out <port-number>.

If using MacOS, use homebrew to install openssl (brew install openssl) before
compiling. If using LinuxOS, make sure that the openssl header files are located
in /usr/include/openssl
